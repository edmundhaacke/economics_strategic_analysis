                    The Economics & Strategic Analysis (ESA) team is a multidisciplinary team of around 45 people from a mixture of professions, including economists, data scientists, behavioural scientists, operational researchers, statisticians and analysts.

                <h5 class="text-lg font-light text-neutral-500 mb-3">
                    We operate as an in-house consultancy, working on multiple and diverse projects across all areas of the NHS. We work directly with the clients who commission our work to scope out and deliver well-defined, time-limited projects. This enables us to play a central, integral role in influencing and tackling some of the biggest strategic challenges currently facing the NHS.

                <h5 class="text-lg font-light text-neutral-500 mb-3">
                    We provide robust and impactful evidence-based analysis, drawing on advanced analytical capabilities delivered through project-based and cross-cutting work.  We use hypothesis-driven techniques to inform and shape solutions to complex, unstructured problems.

                <h5 class="text-lg font-light text-neutral-500 mb-3">
                    We are an inclusive team that promotes and values diversity. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds create a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better patient outcomes.

                    We have a strong focus on impact and bringing more technical and strategic-thinking skills to cross-cutting or complex issues. Our portfolio changes over time in response to business need, but we have expertise working across operational performance, finance, workforce, productivity, mental health, primary care, demand and capacity, behavioural science, and inequalities. We also have our dedicated Behavioural Science Unit and Data Science Hub. During the pandemic, most of the team were redeployed onto COVID and recovery work, diversifying the types of work we have experience in outside of our core project base (including creating products on Foundry and ongoing epidemiological modelling).

                    Our work is largely ‘demand-led’ where we are commissioned by others across NHS England, including the Executive Committee. Some of our work is also ‘horizon scanning led’ where we come up with strategic analytical projects ourselves to get ahead of the curve (e.g., patient pathways).

                <h5 class="text-lg font-light text-neutral-500 mb-3">
                    In addition to day-to-day analytical work, each member of our team has a corporate champion role to support the team. This includes Wellbeing, Learning & Development, Data, Quality Assurance and so much more. We are proud of our team culture: from team socials and team channels as a forum to discuss off-work topics to focus on team wellbeing and pioneering EDI work across CDAO.
