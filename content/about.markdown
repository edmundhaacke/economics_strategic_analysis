## Who we are

The Economics & Strategic Analysis (ESA) team is a multidisciplinary team of around 45 people from a mixture of professions, including economists, data scientists, behavioural scientists, operational researchers, statisticians and analysts. 

We operate as an in-house consultancy, working on multiple and diverse projects across all areas of the NHS. We work directly with the clients who commission our work to scope out and deliver well-defined, time-limited projects. This enables us to play a central, integral role in influencing and tackling some of the biggest strategic challenges currently facing the NHS.

We provide robust and impactful evidence-based analysis, drawing on advanced analytical capabilities delivered through project-based and cross-cutting work.  We use hypothesis-driven techniques to inform and shape solutions to complex, unstructured problems.

We are an inclusive team that promotes and values diversity. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds create a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better patient outcomes.

## Our priorities and objectives

- **Impact:** We address current challenges in healthcare through economic and strategic analysis and align our work with the NHS priorities.  Examples of the types of projects we have completed include modelling and analysis to support our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, analysing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, modelling waiting times in A&E, delivering a net zero carbon NHS and improving uptake of seasonal flu vaccine among health care workers. 
- **Matrix team:** We are a cross-cutting team that is not aligned to a specific programme, function or policy area, allowing us to provide objective and impactful advice. We support matrix working internally as well as cross-functional and collaborative working across CDAO and the organisation.
- **Balance of demand-led and self-generated work:** We respond to the highest organisational priorities, are forward-looking re. NHS challenges & priorities, and undertake anticipatory and precautionary analysis on critical issues and concerns.

## What we do

We have a strong focus on impact and bringing more technical and strategic-thinking skills to cross-cutting or complex issues. Our portfolio changes over time in response to business need, but we have expertise working across operational performance, finance, workforce, productivity, mental health, primary care, demand and capacity, behavioural science, and inequalities. We also have our dedicated Behavioural Science Unit and Data Science Hub. During the pandemic, most of the team were redeployed onto COVID and recovery work, diversifying the types of work we have experience in outside of our core project base (including creating products on Foundry and ongoing epidemiological modelling).

Our work is largely ‘demand-led’ where we are commissioned by others across NHS England, including the Executive Committee. Some of our work is also ‘horizon scanning led’ where we come up with strategic analytical projects ourselves to get ahead of the curve (e.g., patient pathways).

In addition to day-to-day analytical work, each member of our team has a corporate champion role to support the team. This includes Wellbeing, Learning & Development, Data, Quality Assurance and so much more. We are proud of our team culture: from team socials and team channels as a forum to discuss off-work topics to focus on team wellbeing and pioneering EDI work across CDAO.
